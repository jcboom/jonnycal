    As a User Experience practitioner, I am critical of the human-centered design philosophy as I push to broaden its scope and encompass key human aspects such as agency, intersectionality, identity and equity. I am aware that technology is socially constructed, which is to say that there is inherent culture nestled in the code of every software application. I seek to break the myth of autonomous technology through practice and education. My interdisciplinary background provides me with the tools to help design meaningful experiences.

<p>Jonathan Calzada is a doctoral student at the Graduate School of Education and <a href="https://seis.ucla.edu/departments-and-degrees/department-of-information-studies" target="_blank">Information Studies at UCLA</a>. His research investigates how copying and pasting information in the digital world can create a dangerous culture, but also how it opens up opportunities for creative expression. Jonathan holds a <a href="https://seis.ucla.edu/departments-and-degrees/department-of-information-studies/master-of-library-and-information-science" target="_blank">Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS)</a> and a B.A. in <a href="https://anthro.ucla.edu/2016/09/22/lemelson-anthropology-honors-program-2016-jonathan-calzada/" target="_blank">Anthropology</a> with a minor in <a href="https://dh.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities</a> from UCLA. Jonathanâ€™s professional and academic work incorporate inquiries of power and social justice, especially in the spaces within which he is most familiar as a software designer. Having grown up in <a href="https://redwoodcity.stanford.edu/native-americans" target="_blank">Redwood City (California)</a> and around the neighboring <a href="https://americanindiancoc.org/native-american-tribes-the-indian-history-in-palo-alto-california/" target="_blank">Palo Alto area</a>, Jonathan has worked within the information technology sector throughout much of his life. He has held positions as a computer technician, web developer, UX researcher, and product designer. Drawing from his professional experience, Jonathan has focused on the critical study of user interface design and the ways in which designers drive a highly transgressive production of information technology. </p>
