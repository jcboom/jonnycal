  <div class="project-body-description">As a User Experience Researcher, I Conducted UX research activities on SAP products across three main platforms: Cloud, Mobile, and On-Premise.  My primary duties included conducting formative usability studies, ethnographic research, and end-user interviews.  Post-research duties included organizing and executing research data analysis and synthesis sessions with product teams, and the communication of findings to product stakeholders.  I conducted research on many SAP products including SAP CRM solutions, BusinessObjects Intelligence Platform, SAP Mobile Platform and mobile enterprise applications. User research often greatly contributed to minimizing product support costs, increase of end-user satisfaction, and the improvement of the overall user experience of SAP products. Only a few studies are shown below.

            <h4><i class="fa fa-sticky-note fa-lg color-ux" fa-fw aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design Thinking</h4>
            <p>After the UX Research phase, I used the data to produce concrete designs based on educated assumptions about the user, all while remaining flexible and open to aspirational solutions. In order to accomplish this, I took an informal <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/" target="_blank">design thinking</a> approach where sufficient time was spent on divergent thinking and ideation before converging on a CMS design solution. During this phase, all judgment and feasibility concerns were suspended in order to come up with different, and sometimes innovative, ways of meeting CMS user needs and expectations. Out of these activities wireframes and sketches drawn on whiteboards, paper, and ‘stickies’ were produced. In addition, I printed out inspiring UIs gathered from <a href="http://pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, <a href="http://dribbble.com" target="_blank">Dribbble</a>, <a href="http://squarespace.com" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> and other public sites. I then posted them all around the walls of our workspace for quick reference while working. This design phase resulted in an initial idea of a holistic, end-to-end, user-centric CMS that reduced complexity potentially elevating the UX to the next tier.

        <h4><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-lg color-ux" fa-fw aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informed Design Phase</h4>
        <p>User flows, wireframes, Sketch designs and prototypes were iteratively developed informed by <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/the-art-of-guerrilla-usability-testing/" target="_blank">guerilla usability testing</a>. The first ideation and user flows were on paper. I simply wanted to design the basic core functionality of specific modules. I found that a storyboard approach was very helpful and easy to draw out and follow. Once a basic user flow was designed, the actual UI design followed. I continued with low fidelity wireframes for several reasons. First, I wanted to prevent users and stakeholders alike from thinking that the designs were final, which is to say permanent, or difficult to change or modify. Second, I wanted to encourage critique, modifications and even 'do-overs.' Lastly, I wanted to make sure that color, icons, or any other aspects of visual design did not bog down developers and visual designers. The wireframes focused on functionality, features, information architecture, navigation and interaction design.
